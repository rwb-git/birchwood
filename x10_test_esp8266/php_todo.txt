3-12-2021 i moved here from gallons_esp.txt because that file had a confusing mixture of esp todo and php todo. SO THE TOP OF THIS FILE WILL BE DUPLICATED IN UP TO 3 PLACES:

   gallons_esp.txt
   this file, php_todo.txt

gallons discussion:

   esp won't lose all its pulse data when it resets like android tablet did every time I reprogrammed it. esp can of course have disasters.

   simple approaches:

      php stop pruning pulse file on every write. as soon as possible after midnight, maybe after a ping? but have to make sure i don't have two scripts editing the same file at once. the problem
      with letting the pulse handler do it is that pulses might not arrive for several hours after midnight.

         one way would be to let ping handle counting pulses whenever the date changes, but leave the file alone. change pulse prune code to no longer prune like all the others, to most recent 24 hours, but
         to prune something much older

      or this? on every pulse, pulse handler updates a daily_gallons file that simply counts all the pulses received on that day. any other script can read that file and if midnight has passed, update the 
      main gallons file that has the last 30 days or whatever is used for the web page bar chart.

      or esp simply handles all the work, and at midnight sends the new gallons value in repeatedly until there is an ack. <- this is 100x simpler than any php based counting. and esp will know about every 
      pulse including any that php somehow misses. <<<< this is the way to do it. the only reason php counted before was the android restart issue which does not apply to esp. do this.

         gallons_new.php appends to the files gallons_new and gallons_all

         android sends several days worth of data every midnight. this helps if web is down for a long time. maybe esp will keep track of acks and only send data that has not been acked, but the old
         code will be nice to keep around. just skip the part about counting online pulses and leave the pulse file and pulse code simple for now.

         so if I do this:

            use existing online gallons_new.php except delete the part that counts pulses

            esp simply sends url to gallons_new.php same as android. hell, maybe do the exact same thing and always send the last week or so. in that case no need for complex code keeping track of what web knows and what
            web doesn't.

            add an esp button to re-send the gallons url at any time. cool way to check, and easy way to fix in case i wake up and somehow the data isn't updated



      gallons_new looks like this:

            2021045 113    = year then day of year padded with zeros
            2021046 119
            2021047 120
            2021048 120

      i think android sends url that looks like this: g=datecode_gallons_datecode_gallons_datecode_gallons... with newer datecode coming last

      >>> write a button on esp that increments a fake datecode and sends random gallons values to confirm the code works. hell, test the scenario where multiple days are missed by php <<<<

      the code from gallons_new.php that reads the url

               $gpm=$_GET["g"];

               $data = explode("_", trim($gpm));   // datecode gallons datecode gallons etc. I'm not sure i should trim() this

               $index = 0;

               $new_codes = array();

               $new_gallons = array();

               foreach ($data as &$number){

                  if ($index == 0){

                     $index = 1;


                     if ($number > 0){             // it reads a blank value at the end. maybe because I end the url with a _

                        $new_codes[] = $number;

                        $url_datecode = $number;  // this will save the final datecode which will be used to see if pulse file has been shifted for midnight
                     }

                  } else {
                     
                     $index = 0;

                     $new_gallons[] = $number;

                     $save_new_gallons = $number;        // this will have the final value
                  }
               }


               $use_this = $save_new_gallons; // new php will always use value from esp8266

   php calculates gallons each day on some occurence:

      nope not this first pulse

      nope not this first access of web site

      or do exact same as android, and do it on gallons packet from esp? why not keep same code exactly?

         php does not need to calculate because esp does not forget pulse info like android did unless something crazy happens. if i coded to handle every crazy failure i'd never finish

   right now esp does this:

      totally ignores master seconds since midnight

      stores local seconds + 86400

      prunes at midnight: deletes all records < 86400. saves all other values after subtracting 86400. so, if this works perfectly it saves all of yesterdays pulses. worst case when power has not failed will miss one pulse but
      the odds of that are slim. if power has been out or my system has issues it might miss pulses anyway. but i guess the issue is this:

         if power is out for 6 hours from 11 pm to 5 am then maybe there were no pulses to miss. BUT IT'S A MISTAKE to use 86400 in this case. fix this no matter what. in this example here it will discard 5 hours of yesterday's
         pulses which are never needed for plotting, but are needed for calculating gallons. DERP, JUST CALC gallons before pruning, or in the same operation so the lost data will be counted. and how is it that esp has pulse
         data that it has not already counted. 

      sends simple notification to php

         php does this in pulse.php:

            get rid of records older than 86400

            save new record as true millenium





--- auto_fetch ---

   if i have two local boxes sending data to web, like i do now with android and esp, can online find the best data source and serve it

      if data is old for one, check the other and use it

      where would this decision be made? html page has img-src php file, so that php file handles it?
















online tank plot is too ragged








colors for weekdays are different on x10 vs normal




figure out how to smooth tank plot. one data point every five or ten minutes then smooth the curve between or whatever






time shift is wrong when data is old. it shifts dream too much. the flow blocks are perfectly shifted, but the legend is shifted too much

time_block.php reads old file wrong






does my code read_time_file twice? is this new or old too

online switching sources for jay

   let me easily edit a small text file to do it

   let esp have a button to do it

   test it once esp online files are clean enough

   test it first in another fake web page that can access either source?

   it seems to work except EVERY include in the other directory has to specify the path

      and if this isn't based on the root then it won't work from within that directory, but i suppose i can handle that, but it might be nice to fix that messy part




maybe get crazy and look at data is old, and if one is good and one is bad auto switch



the new pulse-float code fills the plot with float if any pulses. the problem is right now a fake pulse came through, so maybe if the pulse count is ridiculously low (?) and no float events then don't draw float at all. the old code is ok in that respect.

to use files in a subdirectory:

   any html url link anywhere will point to something in the top directory. no way to avoid this.

   that file in the top dir has to have php code to chdir and then the subdirectory files work fine

   so, the old main menu is in the top dir and can be used by any file any where. 

      any links in it that go to sub dirs have to use php switching code in a top-dir file

   in the future when i want to silently link to either top dir or sub dir, the php switcher code in the top dir will look at a small text file in the top dir, and that switching code can use top dir or chdir to subdir

   pulse plots have the four pulse links and the main menu link. all will go back to code in the top dir

      to be just like it was before, the top dir pulse links will simply chdir to the sub dir. but i should go ahead and put the switcher code that reads the source_select.txt file because eventually that's how they will
      work. just like all the switcher links, eventually they will go to the top dir android data or the sub dir esp data. 

      i repeat: eventually every url link in any menu will go to a simple top dir switcher file that selects top dir android data or sub dir esp data. simple, actually.

      and i think the switcher files will be same on any host since they only select top dir or sub dir, and if i name the sub dir the same then the same switcher code works, and i need these:

         huge 

         simple

         p1
         p2
         p4
         p8

>>> from here on out, i think ALL the files on biz and dream will be the same. MENU has full links to both sites so it's common. no other files need full links - that was a mistake on my part. <<<
>>> from here on out, AND THIS INCLUDES the retarded water2.php vs. water2_new_fake.php, but don't we all have bookmarks to that shit? the new menus use switcher code, but what about jay, hunter, and rod bookmarks?
>>> yes, my phone bookmarks to water2_new_fake.php on fork20, so that has to still work. if someone were to bookmark the new link after everything is switched, then that would be switch.php on both sites, and goes
>>> to water2.php on both sites.

>>> so don't forget that i HAVE TO MAINTAIN water2 and water2_new_fake on fork20 FOREVER.



   for now it has to be more complex: all the old menus need to use the old files. the only switcher code should be on menu2 and x10 files 

      this means different versions of waterp8 4 2 1 in top dir and x10 dir. top dir are old style.

      x10 dir pulse files waterp8 etc will be accessible through menu2 and then they will all use switcher code for the 4 pulse links




>>>>       HTML GOES BACK TO THE TOP DIR    <<<<

make jay's links work with either source

   done: also make water2 and water2_new_fake go to same code = water2_new_fake -> water2

   to make old bookmarks switch to either site, i have to change the old files to be simple switcher files that choose the desired source, similar to how menu2 works, except the files
   won't be "switch***" but will have the old file name, and the old file contents will be somewhere else. 
      
      test this first: dummy.php tries to include water2.

         but didn't i just do that on dream to get rid of water2_...fake?


this is water2_new_fake.php

      <?php

         include "water2.php"; // these should never have had different names. keep this one because we all have bookmarks to dream-water2_new_fake and to biz-water2, so i need both to work
      ?>

this is switchp1.php

      <?php

         $fpcut = fopen("source_select.txt", "r");

         $select = fgets($fpcut); 
         
         fclose($fpcut);

         if ($select != 1){
            
            chdir('x10_test_esp8266');
         }

         include("waterp1.php"); 
          
      ?> 

so, the switch comes in water2.php, so that old bookmarks to water2_new... and water2.php will both wind up there, and the two sites are most similar

water.php      simple site will have switch code very much like switch_simple.php

water2 and water2_new_fake will be like switch.php

waterp1..8 will be like switchp1..8
