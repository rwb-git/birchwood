   i stopped looking at it after UPS died and he ignored my request that he replace it. at next $100 renewal look at the site. if it has been dead it should show the days:hours etc, so if it
   has been dead very long assume it died and he gave up begging me to fix it. hopefully. if it's still up lol pay the damn bill because the website might be a bargaining chip if they
   get on me for shit in my lot or truck repairs. or whatever.

   start with showing status row for float. float_state.txt has this:


      1613243917 0 1613244283 0 1613244587 0 1613254105 0 1613254470 0 1613255264 0 1613258139 1 1613258322 1 1613258755 1 1613263755 0 1613297779 1 1613301520 0 1613323903 1 1613329288 0 

   in general it should alternate 1 0 1 0 but my code needs to also handle screwed up shit like this.

   remember the 5 hour difference which only affects the legend. everything else is server time

   get local millenium. then it's a simple task to determine how many seconds ago all of the events occurred.

      so do that first. read float_state.txt and just print out the milleniums and associated states. do this in a new file called test_float.php
